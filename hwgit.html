      <h2>What is GIT? Why do we need source code Version Control System?</h2>
      <p>Git is a version control system that is open source and free. This means that everyone has access to what you publish. Git is the most widely used version control ssytem in the world. With Git storage becomes much more efficient because it does not store data in the traditional way. Instead Git takes a snapshot of your files and stores a reference of that snapshot. If a files does not change, Git will not store the file again.
      Version Control is important because it will keep track of your files over time. This will help you in case you make a mistake and need to go back to previous versions. Source code Version Control is also important because it will help keep files and folders updated more easily and also keep track of who made changes and when they were made. Instead of just saving, Version Control system requires the user to commit their updated file. This implies that you will have to specify a reason for the change and what it actually does. 
      Version Control System maintains a list of all the files and all the changes that have been made to those files.

      <h2>Describe local repo</h2>
      <p> A local repository is a repository that commits to your local repository Git does not need any sort of server to make this happen. It has the same features as a global repository. The local repository can connect to the global and use files in a shared folder.

      <h2>Describe remote repo</h2>
      <p> A remote repository is a Git repository version that is not local to you. It can be either on the internet or it can be some other network. It is possible to clone a remote repository and thereby create local versions. This allows several users to work on the same project and making it easy to pull and push action to the remote repository.

      <h2>Describe how to use GIT in Team Project with multiple developers work on the same project at the same time</h2>
      <p> This is done by cloning the remote repository from Github. First the team will have to decide on an owner of the repository. The owner can then add collaborators. They will then all have the same repository and by that they can work on their local repository before pull the file to the remote repository and share your work with the other developers.
