      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker is a sofware tool used as a container that allows users to create, test and deplay applications. The Docker itself is a virtual machine, which makes it possible to Linux Kernel on one machine and then use the same application on a different machine that is running the same Linux operating system. The benefit of this is that by having a virtual machine, you will savbe time and also size of the application will be smaller. Docker is very popular because the users can just focus on development of their project and do not have to worry about what operating system or platform it can run on.

      <h2>What is VM (virtual machine)</h2>
      <p>A virtual machine is a software program that is often called an image. This image behaves like an actual computer. The sofware is imitating the hardware and the end user will have the same view on a virtual machine as they would with the hardware. When running the virtual machine, it is completely seperated from the computer its being run on, which means that the virtual machine cannot tamper with the computer itself. Each virtual machine actually provides its own hardware, which includes CPU, memory and hard drives.
